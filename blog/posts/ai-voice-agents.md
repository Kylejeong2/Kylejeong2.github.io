# Building AI Voice Agents

_March 19, 2024_

Building conversational AI agents that can handle real-time voice interactions is challenging. Here's what I've learned from my experiments.

## The Challenge

The main challenges in building voice agents are:
- Low latency responses
- Natural interruption handling
- Context maintenance
- Voice quality and stability

## My Approach

I've been working on a system that uses:
- Whisper for real-time transcription
- Custom fine-tuned LLMs for responses
- Elevenlabs for voice synthesis
- WebRTC for low-latency audio streaming

## Results So Far

The current system can:
- Respond in under 500ms
- Handle natural interruptions
- Maintain context across conversations
- Switch voices based on context

## Next Steps

I'm working on:
- Reducing latency further
- Improving voice quality
- Adding more personality to responses
- Building a web interface for testing

Stay tuned for more updates on this project!
