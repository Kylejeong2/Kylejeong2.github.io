# Sample Blog Post

_March 19, 2024_

This is a sample blog post to demonstrate how the blog functionality works. You can write your posts in Markdown format, which makes it easy to format text and add various elements like:

## Headers
### Subheaders

- Bullet points
- Lists
- And more

```python
# You can even include code blocks
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

To add a new blog post:

1. Create a new .md file in the `blog/posts` directory
2. Add the post metadata to `blog/posts/index.json`
3. Write your content in Markdown format
4. The post will automatically appear on your blog page

That's it! Happy blogging!
