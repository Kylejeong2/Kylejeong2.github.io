# Why I Started VEST @ UCLA

_March 15, 2024_

UCLA has amazing technical talent but lacked a strong startup community. That's why I started VEST (Venture Engineering & Startup Team).

## The Problem

Despite having:
- Top CS/Engineering programs
- Talented students
- Great location
- Access to capital

UCLA was missing:
- Startup community
- Builder network
- Founder mentorship
- Technical resources

## Building VEST

Our approach:
1. Weekly builder sessions
2. Technical workshops
3. Founder office hours
4. Project collaborations

## Current Progress

In just 2 months:
- 100+ active members
- 5 startups launched
- 10+ ongoing projects
- Weekly technical workshops

## Future Plans

We're working on:
- Startup incubator program
- VC networking events
- Technical mentorship
- Inter-university collaborations

Join us in building UCLA's startup ecosystem!
